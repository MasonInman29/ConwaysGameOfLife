Research Project over Conway's Game of Life

**Why?** To research algorithms and the Turing Complete nature of the deterministic rules in the game.

**Rules:**
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

These rules can form many formations such as gliders, oscillators, and spaceships which can be used to make AND, OR, and NOT gates. This makes these structures functionally complete and you can theoretically make a computer within this game.

For this project, I explored building the game and many known structures.

For more information, Wikipedia offers many graphics and more in-depth (for Wikipedia) explanations of the structures. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
